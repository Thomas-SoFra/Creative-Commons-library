The SoFA Creative Commons library
=================================

The mission of `Sociocracy for All <https://www.sociocracyforall.org/>`_ (SoFA) is to make resources for learning and implementing `Sociocracy <https://www.sociocracyforall.org/what-is-sociocracy/>`_ accessible to everyone.  As part of our commitment to that mission, SoFA founders have published the books `"Many Voices, One Song" <https://www.sociocracyforall.org/mvos/>`_ and `"Who Decides Who Decides?" <https://www.sociocracyforall.org/who-decides-who-decides/>`_ under the `Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed>`_.  We are using this space to allow anyone to access and contribute to the source markup for these texts.

We imagine that you might use this source markup to share these books with members of your community, to offer improvements to the books, and to play with the content of the books in other ways that we believe have the potential to benefit us all.

Governance and communication
----------------------------

The Creative Commons Circle is a helping circle that SoFA created to facilitate this project.  The current members of this helping circle are CJ O'Reilly and John L. Clark.  We invite you to join us in discussing this project on `the Creative Commons Helping Circle Google Group <https://groups.google.com/a/sociocracyforall.org/g/creative.commons.helping.circle>`_.  We also welcome you to use the GitHub tools here (such as `issues <https://github.com/sociocracyforall/Creative-Commons-library/issues>`_ and `pull requests <https://github.com/sociocracyforall/Creative-Commons-library/pulls>`_) to communicate with us and the community about your vision for the future of this library.

The books and other materials
-----------------------------

"Many Voices, One Song" (MVOS) is a detailed Sociocracy manual written by SoFA founders Ted J. Rau and Jerry Koch-Gonzales.  "Who Decides Who Decides?" (WDWD) is a booklet about starting a group using Sociocracy written by Ted J. Rau.

The Creative Commons Circle is focusing first on setting up this project to provide access to "Many Voices, One Song" due to limitations on our energy and in order to learn more about how to connect well with the larger community.  We hope this work will generate enough enthusiasm to give us energy to continue on to WDWD and possibly other SoFA texts.

Diagrams and examples from MVOS are available in `the MVOS Google photo folder <https://photos.app.goo.gl/iH1Qc3yA3eJBTQ1q2>`_.  Examples and templates from WDWD are available on `the WDWD resource page <https://www.sociocracyforall.org/who-decides-who-decides-resource-page/>`_.
